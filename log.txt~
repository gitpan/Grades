r1945,1946,1947:Groupwork::NoFault-totalPercent:
round_to_2_decimal_places_precision

I have to quote the precision in '100.00' to
prevent 'prove' (or perl?) removing them and
failing the test now.                       

I notice that Devel::REPL is also quoting the     
'100.00', but not the 66.67.
